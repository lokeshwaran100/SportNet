## Overview
SportNet is a one-of-a-kind crowdfunding and betting platform designed to empower athletes from underdeveloped or developing countries. Our mission is to bridge the gap between talent and opportunity by providing a platform where athletes can share their stories, raise funds, and gain recognition.

## Problem Statement
Many athletes in underdeveloped or developing countries face significant challenges in pursuing their passion for sports due to a lack of resources. Even if they have the necessary equipment, limited travel costs often prevent them from participating in tournaments.

## Solution
SportNet allows athletes to create profiles and campaigns tailored to their specific needs to raise donations from supporters. Here's how it works:

- **Athlete Profiles**: Athletes can tell their stories, showcase their strengths, and outline their aspirations.
- **Sponsor Engagement**: Sponsors can browse active campaigns, support athletes they believe in, and help them achieve their goals.
- **Fund Withdrawal**: Athletes can withdraw funds partially or completely and publicize their accomplishments, increasing their profile.
- **Betting**: Visitors can place bets on athletes, with prizes settled on-chain, and a fee charged for facilitation.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts for Crowdfunding**: Secure and transparent funding through blockchain technology.
- **Profile and Campaign Creation**: Easy-to-use interfaces for athletes, sponsors, and users.
- **Active Campaign Viewing**: Sponsors can explore and support various active campaigns.
- **Betting Platform**: Engage visitors with a betting page and smart contracts for secure transactions.
- **NFT Rewards**: Sponsors receive NFTs as a token of appreciation.
